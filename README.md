# Accelerate
Accelerate is a powerful command-line interface (CLI) tool designed to supercharge the development process for Go-based web applications. With Accelerate, you can swiftly create the baseline structure for your Go web applications and streamline the setup process, saving valuable time and effort for developers.

## Basic Usage
Accelerate is designed to simply the process of starting a new WebApp project, allowing you to focus on developing business logic rather than the infrastructure setup. With just one command, Accelerate will create a new project for you.
``` bash
accelerate github.com/MichaelCduBois/rickroll rickroll
```
This command initializes a new go module as `github.com/MichaelCduBois/rickroll` within the `rickroll` directory, providing you with a solid foundation to start building your web application without the hassle of manual setup.
